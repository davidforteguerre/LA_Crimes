# LA_Crimes
Los Angeles Crime Data Analysis (data visualization project). 
An interactive version of the project can be found at https://tabsoft.co/2ZgYcGV. You can filter by year (2010-2019), by crime type, etc. The dashboard is connectred to a very large dataset (1,000,000+ rows) stored on the Tableau Public server, so the pages take time to load.
