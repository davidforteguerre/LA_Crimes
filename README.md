# LA_Crimes
Los Angeles Crime Data Analysis (data visualization project). An interactive version of the project can be found at https://tabsoft.co/2ZgYcGV. You can filter by year (2010-2019), by crime, by whatever you'd like depending on what you want to see. The dashboard is linked to a dataset that has over a million records though, so the pages take time to load.
